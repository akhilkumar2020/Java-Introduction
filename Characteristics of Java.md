# Java-Introduction
In this section, I describe Java Characteristics.
CHARACTERISTICS/FEATURES OF JAVA: - A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below.
1.	Simple
2.	Object-Oriented
3.	Portable
4.	Platform independent
5.	Secured
6.	Robust
7.	Architecture Neutral
8.	Multithreaded
9.	Distributed
10.	Dynamic

1. Simple: - Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple and easy to understand. Java is a simple programming language because of:
•	Java syntax is easy.
•	Java has removed many complicated features like pointers, operator overloading, etc.

2. Object-Oriented: - Java is an object-oriented programming language. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm (Programming paradigm is an approach to solving problems using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques). 

3. Robust: - Java programs are reliable because of a strong memory management system, and automatic garbage collection. There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java.

4. Architecture neutral: - Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation-dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed. In C programming, the int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.

5. Portable: - Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform.

6. Platform independence: - Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).
 

7. Secure: - Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Its programs always run in a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with almost null interaction with the Operating System, thus it is one of the most secure. Java is secured because:
•	No explicit pointer.
•	Java programs can run inside the JVM.
•	Class loader.
•	Byte code verifier.

8. Multithreaded: - A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Multi-threading is a Java feature that facilitates the execution of two or more parts of a program at the same time to maximize CPU efficiency.
