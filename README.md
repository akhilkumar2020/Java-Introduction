# Java-Introduction
In this section, I describe the Java programming language and its history.
INTRODUCTION TO JAVA: - 
JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc. in 1991 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed by James Gosling and his team. 
Java is a simple programming language, as well as the writing, compiling, and debugging of a program, is easy. The main idea behind Java development 
is “WRITE ONCE AND RUN ANYWHERE” (WORA). Java is a “Compiled as well as Interpreted programming language”, which means a Java program is firstly compiled
by the compiler, and after that, the byte code is executed by the interpreter then Java is compiled as well as interpreted programming language. 
The first version of JDK was launched in 1995.

EVOLUTION OF JAVA: - Java is a popular programming language because it covers a wide area in the IT sector and software development industry. 
Java is a high-level, robust, object-oriented, and secure programming language. Java was originally designed for television, modem, routers, and Setup boxes. 
The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, 
Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members 
started the project in the early '90s.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF JAVA.
1.	Sir James Gosling and his team initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of Sun microsystem engineers is called Green Team.
2.	Initially, it was designed for small, systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes, and tv.
3.	Firstly, it was called "Green Talk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was dot gt.
4.	After that, it was called “Oak” and was developed as a part of the green project.
5.	Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.	
6.	The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology.
7.	According to James Gosling, "Java name was one of the top choices along with Silk". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members chose Java over other names.
8.	Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced. Java's name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.
9.	Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.
10.	In 1995, Time magazine called Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995.
11.	JDK 1.0 was released on January 23, 1996. Since the first release of Java, there have been many additional features added to the language. 
12.	Now Java is being used in Windows applications, Web applications, enterprise applications, mobile applications, electronics cards, etc. Each new version adds new features in Java.

EDITIONS OF JAVA: -
1.	JAVA SE – SE stands for Standard Edition, which contains basic classes of Java.
2.	JAVA EE - EE stands for Enterprise Edition, which contains classes that are beyond Java SE.
3.	JAVA ME - ME stands for Micro Edition for developing code for portable devices.
