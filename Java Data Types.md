DATA TYPES: - Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in Java:

1.	Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, and double.
2.	Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.
