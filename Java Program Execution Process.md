JAVA PROGRAM EXECUTION PROCESS: - Java programs involve 2 steps execution process.
1. Compilation process.
2. Execution/Run process.

Compilation process: - When a program is created, we can compile the program. The compiler compiles the program and, if after compiling the program the compiler does not find any error, we can run it further and get the desired output

Execution/Run process: - At runtime, the following steps are performed:
a. Class loader: It is the subsystem of JVM that is used to load class files.
b. Bytecode Verifier: Now the bytecode verifier checks the bytecode for its integrity and if no issues are found passes it to the interpreter.
c. Interpreter: Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.
