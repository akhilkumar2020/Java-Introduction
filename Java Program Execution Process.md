JAVA PROGRAM EXECUTION PROCESS: - Java programs involve 2 steps execution process.
1. Compilation process.
2. Execution/Run process.

Compilation process: - Now once the program is created and does not have any errors, we can compile the program. The compiler compiles the program and, if there are no errors after compiling the program, 
we can further run it and get the desired output

Execution/Run process: - At runtime, the following steps are performed:
a. Class loader: It is the subsystem of JVM that is used to load class files.
b. Bytecode Verifier: Now the bytecode verifier checks the bytecode for its integrity and if no issues are found passes it to the interpreter.
c. Interpreter: Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.
