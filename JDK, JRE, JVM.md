JDK: - JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment that is used to develop Java applications 
      and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools. The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such 
      as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. to complete the development of a Java 
      Application.

JRE: - JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and it provides an environment to execute Java programs. 
      It is also platform dependent like JDK. It consists of JVM, Java libraries, and other classes for the smooth execution of the program. It doesnâ€™t contain 
      any development tools like a compiler, debugger, etc. If we only want to execute a program, we just need to install JRE and not JDK.
