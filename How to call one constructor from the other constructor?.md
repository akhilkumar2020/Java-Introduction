Question - How to call one constructor from another constructor?
Answer - Within the same class if we want to call one constructor from another we use this() method. Based on the number of parameters we pass appropriately this()             method is called. Restrictions for using this method:
                                                              1) this must be the first statement in the constructor 
                                                              2) we cannot use two this() methods in the constructor
