JAR FORMAT: - JAR stands for Java Archive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for aggregating (compressing) many files into one. 
              Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool. The JAR format also supports compression, which reduces the size of the file.


Advantages of using JAR files: -
•	Security: - By providing a digital signature in our JAR File, we enhance the security of Java files, as the authorized user who recognizes our signature can access 
              the files.
•	Portability: - It is easy to handle, create, maintain, update, etc.
•	Compression: - It is used to compress the size of the files. 
•	Decrease Download Time: - we are using a JAR file then we need to download only one single file hence it reduces the download time since we don't need to download
                            multiple files.
•	Packaging: - Using this tool, we bundled our various types of files (like text, audio, video, images, etcetera) in a single place. So, in terms of development, 
                it reduces the burden of storing multiple files in a single folder.
