In this section, I describe the OOPS Structure.

OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING STRUCTURE: - Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc. 
The basic concept of OOPs is to create objects, re-use them throughout the program, and manipulate these objects to get results. OOP meaning “Object Oriented 
Programming” is a popularly known and widely used concept in modern programming languages like Java.

OOPS Concepts: -
1.	Class – Blueprint of an object. 
2.	Object - Real-world Entity. An object has a state and Behavior.
3.	Inheritance - Provide IS-A relationship.
4.	Abstraction – Hide the Implementation only show essential things.
5.	Polymorphism - Single object work in different situations.
6.	Encapsulation – Wrapping of Methods and Data into a single unit.
7.	Aggregation - Provide HAS-A relationship
